cd goggins-alarm
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Install Expo Go**:

   - Download Expo Go from the App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
   - Create an Expo account in the Expo Go app

2. **Sign In to Expo**:

   ```bash
   npx expo login
   ```

   - Use the same account credentials on both your development machine and mobile device

3. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

   - The `--tunnel` option is recommended for better connectivity
   - You'll see a QR code in your terminal

4. **Connect Your Device**:
   - **iOS**: Use your iPhone's Camera app to scan the QR code
   - **Android**: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code
   - Make sure your device and computer are on the same WiFi network

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. **Package Version Mismatches**:

   ```bash
   npx expo install
   ```

   This will update all packages to their correct versions

2. **Clear Cache and Reinstall**:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Network Issues**:

   - Try turning off mobile data on your device
   - Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
   - Use the tunnel option if LAN connection fails

4. **Expo Go Issues**:
   - Close and reopen Expo Go
   - Make sure you're signed into the same Expo account on both devices
   - Try manually entering the URL shown in the terminal

### Development Tips

- Use `npx expo start --tunnel` for more reliable connections
- Keep Expo Go updated to the latest version
- The development server automatically reloads when you make changes to the code
- Use the developer menu (shake device or press Cmd+D/Ctrl+D) to access debugging tools

## Usage

1. Set your alarm time and days for it to repeat
2. When the alarm goes off, you'll be prompted to take a photo of your running shoes
3. The app uses AI to verify that the photo contains running shoes
4. Once verified, the alarm turns off and you're ready to start your workout!
